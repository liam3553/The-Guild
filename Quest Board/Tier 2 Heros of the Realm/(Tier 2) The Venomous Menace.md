**Quest Description:**  
A foul creature has emerged from the depths of the Rotting Mire, spreading its toxic influence across the land. The villagers of Thornhill are living in fear, as a Venom Troll has taken residence near their borders, poisoning the land and anyone unfortunate enough to cross its path.

This monstrous troll is even more dangerous than its kin, secreting potent venom that saps the strength of the bravest warriors. Its regenerative abilities are bolstered by this venom, making it an almost unstoppable force. We need a group of capable adventurers to hunt down this beast and put an end to its vile existence before the entire mire becomes uninhabitable.

**Objectives:**  
- Track the Venom Troll to its lair in the Rotting Mire  
- Slay the Venom Troll and bring back its venom gland as proof  
- Ensure the safety of the surrounding region by neutralizing any lingering toxins

- 200 gold pieces and 2 Potions of Greater Healing

**Special Notes:**  
- The Venom Troll’s regenerative abilities are formidable; fire or acid will be essential to prevent it from healing.  
- The creature’s venom can weaken and paralyze, so stock up on antitoxins and healing potions before the hunt.  
- The Rotting Mire is a treacherous swamp filled with other dangers—be prepared for a difficult journey.  
- Nightshade Moss is known to be found near the bases of rotting trees deep within the mire. Be cautious, as this area is rife with other poisonous creatures.
