**Quest Description:**  
The peaceful village of Orlane has fallen into darkness. Once a thriving community, it now teeters on the brink of despair. Some villagers have disappeared without a trace, while others have grown cold, distant, and strange. Rumors whisper of a dark force at work, spreading fear and suspicion throughout the region.

Mayor Ormond of Orlane has issued a desperate plea for aid, fearing that an insidious cult has taken root in the village. He believes that the Cult of the Reptile God, a sinister and ancient sect, is behind the town’s troubles. The cult is said to worship a malevolent deity of serpents, and its influence grows stronger with each passing day.

Adventurers are needed to uncover the truth behind these mysterious occurrences, confront the cult, and put an end to their dark rituals before they can summon their terrible god into the world.

- Investigate the village of Orlane to identify cult members and their leaders  
- Infiltrate the cult and locate their hidden temple  
- Defeat the Cult of the Reptile God and destroy their leader, the Naga

- The swamps surrounding Orlane are treacherous and filled with dangerous creatures. Watch your step, and consider gathering information in town before venturing into the wild.
