Client: Edgra Durmoot, Speaker of Dougan's Hole
Details: Dougan's Hole is beset by winter wolves that stalk the outskirts of town. "Don't know how many, but them wolves are big as horses!" says a local with small, misshapen ears. "They know words an' got a mighty vocab'lary!" says another with pointed teeth. "By Thruun's Stones, they caught fair Sil and her lovely brother Finn th' other day," says a third, who bears more than a passing resemblance to the other two. A fourth who looks like their sister chimes in. "Dang winter wolves say they ain't givin' 'em back till the town coughs up a king's ransom in food and gold. This town barely got enough to feed its own, and there ain't no gold. Ain't no one allowed to leave town. Dem wolves vow to kill anyone who tries!" Speaker Durmoot firmly believes that the missing teenagers are dead, and she's not about to give food to the winter wolves when her own people barely have enough to feed themselves.
