Other: None

Client: Phandalin Miners Exchange
Details: Vermeillon, a mountain village, was once a well-known mining town home to a plentiful platinum mine. The whereabouts of the village have been lost to time, and legends say that it died out by slow, unknown means. We recently hired a diviner to help us with this mystery. They informed us of a book at Candlekeep--the legendary library--holds clues to the mystery. Use this book and find Vermeillon!
