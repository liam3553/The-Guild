**Quest Description:**  
The harsh and unforgiving tundra of Icewind Dale is no place for the faint of heart. A group of dwarves, tasked with delivering a sled loaded with iron ingots to Bryn Shander, found this out the hard way. Ambushed by a ferocious yeti, they were forced to abandon their cargo as the beast tore their comrade, Oobok, limb from limb.

Now, the surviving dwarves seek brave adventurers to retrieve the sled of iron ingots. The cargo is vital to the dwarves of Bryn Shander, and they are willing to offer a gemstone worth fifty gold pieces to each party member as a reward. Additionally, the dwarves promise a 10% discount on goods at Blackiron Blades—an invaluable advantage in the icy wastelands of Icewind Dale.

**Objectives:**  
- Locate and recover the abandoned sled of iron ingots  
- Return the sled safely to the dwarves in Bryn Shander

- Track down the polar bear and ensure it is safely freed from the sled or any hazards it might be facing. 

**Reward:**

**Special Notes:**  
- Although the yeti most likely moved on, other creatures of the wilderness may have taken an interest in the sled. Be prepared for a potential confrontation.  
- Icewind Dale’s extreme cold and unpredictable weather can be as deadly as any monster; ensure you’re equipped with proper winter gear.  
- The polar bear, while initially a beast of burden, may now be aggressive or territorial; approach with caution.
