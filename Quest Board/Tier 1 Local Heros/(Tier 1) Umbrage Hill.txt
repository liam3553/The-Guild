Tier 1 urgent quest

Main Quest: Convince Adabra to return to Phandalin
Reward: 50 gp; unlock the ability to purchase potions of healing (common) from Blackiron Blades

Client: Harbin Wester, Phandalin Townmaster
Details: The local midwife--an acolyte of Chauntea named Adabra Gwynn--lives by herself in a stone windmill on the side of a hill a few miles south of Phandalin. With dragon sightings becoming more common, it’s not safe for her to be alone. Urge Adabra to return to Phandalin. Once she’s safe, visit Townmaster Harbin Wester to claim a reward of 25 gp.
