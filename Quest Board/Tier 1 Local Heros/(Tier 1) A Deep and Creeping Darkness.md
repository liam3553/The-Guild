**Quest Description:**  
The village of Vermeillon, once a prosperous mining town known for its rich platinum deposits, vanished into legend after its sudden and mysterious decline. The Phandalin Miners Exchange has long sought to rediscover this lost village and reclaim its valuable resources. Rumors speak of the village’s slow demise, with residents reportedly succumbing to an overwhelming sense of dread and fear before abandoning their homes.

Recently, a diviner was employed to shed light on Vermeillon’s fate. The seer pointed to a tome housed in Candlekeep, a legendary library, which holds vital clues to the village’s location and its dark past. Adventurers are needed to find the village, uncover the source of its downfall, and prepare the area for reclamation. The Exchange is eager to bring the village back to life, but be warned—the darkness that consumed Vermeillon may still linger.

**Objectives:**  
- Use the information from the tome to locate the lost village of Vermeillon
- Investigate the village and its surrounding areas to uncover the source of the mysterious terror
- Report your findings back to the Phandalin Miners Exchange

**Special Notes:**  
- The villagers of Vermeillon were said to have succumbed to an overwhelming terror, as though something unseen and malevolent had taken hold. Be cautious; fear itself may be your greatest enemy.  
- Vermeillon is located in a remote and rugged area; the journey itself may be treacherous. Ensure you are well-supplied before setting out.  
- The mine may hold more than just valuable ores—those who have ventured into such dark places before have spoken of unsettling noises and shadows that seem to move on their own.
