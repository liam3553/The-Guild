**Quest Description:**  
Dougan's Hole, a small settlement in the harsh climes of Icewind Dale, is currently under siege by a pack of formidable winter wolves. These beasts, as large as horses and possessing an unnerving intelligence, have taken to terrorizing the town and demanding a king's ransom in food and gold—demands the town cannot meet.

The wolves have also captured two teenagers, Sil and her brother Finn, threatening their lives unless their demands are met. Speaker Edgra Durmoot is desperate for help, unwilling to surrender to the wolves’ demands and refusing to let her people starve or be extorted. She needs brave adventurers to drive the winter wolves away and secure the safety of her town.

**Special Notes:**  
- Winter wolves are known for their intelligence and magical abilities, including their fearsome breath weapon. Be prepared for a tough fight and possible magical traps.  
- The town of Dougan's Hole is isolated, and the wolves have threatened anyone attempting to leave or enter the town. Ensure you are well-prepared before venturing out.  
- Saving the teenagers is critical not only for their lives but also for the morale of the townsfolk. Their rescue may sway local sentiment and aid in the town's defense.
