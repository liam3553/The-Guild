Details: Kilian, one of our Tier 2 guild members, has gone missing whilst investigating the town of Orlane. What was once a small and thriving community, the population of Orlane has undergone a steady decline. Some homes have been found abandoned, with food on the table or crops unharvested in the field. No explanation has ever been offered for these strange disappearances. Sometimes the families have returned in a week or two, and other times they hace never been heard from again. Something sinister is at work in Orlane!
