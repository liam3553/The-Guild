# Welcome to The Guild!
This is an episodic D&D format constructed to facilitate forming a group and playing. The episodic format means that no story carries over between sessions. This should allow for group members (and/or characters!) to change between sessions with no issue. A list of quests can be found on the quest board that a party can accept. Quests are broken up into tiers. As player characters complete quests, they will advance in level and in tier. They will also accumulate coinage, magic items, and special unlockables that carry over between quests.

The basic gameplay loop is
1. Accept quest
2. Form party
3. Complete quest
4. Increase level/tier
5. Spend money at shops
6. Repeat

The remainder of this guide explains details about the quest board, the player characters, and actions between quests.


## Quest Board
This section outlines details regarding the quests available on the quest board.


### Quest outlines
Each quest entry has a title, a tier, a main quest objective, a reward, a client, and a description. Sometimes, a quest will have optional subquest objectives that can be completed for additional rewards. To complete a quest, the main objective must be completed. Upon completion of a quest, the party will be rewarded with coinage, magic items, and special unlockables to be distributed between the party unless otherwise noted. An example of a special unlockable is a discount at the between-quest shops.


### Quest Tiers
There are four tiers of quests. The list of currently available guild quests has tier information. Each tier corresponds to the following range of character levels
- Tier 1: 1-4
- Tier 2: 5-10
- Tier 3: 11-16
- Tier 4: 17-20  
Caution: Quests are balanced for party size, but not party level. E.g., a party of one Lvl 3 character will have an easier quest than a party of four Lvl 3 characters. However, a party of four Lvl 1 characters will have the exact same quest as a party of four Lvl 5 characters.


### Accepting a quest
To accept a quest, simply select a quest from the quest board, gather your party, and inform your DM that you would like to accept a quest. Once the quest is accepted, a date and time can be determined for a session to complete the quest. A character may accept a quest in the current tier and any lower tiers. Quests are indefinitely repeatable.


## Player characters
This section outlines information regarding player characters, including making a character and character advancement.


### Making a character
You may create as many characters as you like. Only character races, classes, and subclasses that appear in the official D&D 5e sourcebooks are allowed. Please let me know when you are making a character. You may make a character starting at any level. Magic items _are not permitted_ during character creation. You are, however, allowed 50 gp times your starting level.


### Character advancement
Your character advances in level after the number of quests equal to their tier level (e.g., a Tier 1 character levels up after one quest, a Tier 2 character levels up after 2 quests). Your character advances in tier once both of the following conditions are met:
- They are the minimum level of the next tier
- The urgent quest of the current tier is completed


## Between quests
As your character completes quests and accumulates loot, that wealth can be spent on various things. This includes the Blackiron Blades shop and a magic item shop.


### Blackiron Blades
The Blackiron Blades is the shop that The Guild purchases equipment from. A complete list of items available for purchase is available 


### Magic item shop
The magic item shop is under construction.
